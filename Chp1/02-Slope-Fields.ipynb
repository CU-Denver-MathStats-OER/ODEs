    "A <font color='blue'>**slope field**</font> is a graphical representation of a rate of change equation. Given a rate of change equation, if we plug in particular values of $(t,y)$ then $\\dfrac{dy}{dt}$ tells you the slope of the tangent vector to the solution at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the rate of change equation $\\dfrac{dy}{dt}=y+2t$.  At the point $(1, 3)$, the value of $\\dfrac{dy}{dt}$ is $5$. Thus, the slope field for this equation would show a vector at the point $(1, 3)$ with slope $5$.  A slope field depicts the exact slope of many such vectors, where we take each vector to be uniform length. Slope fields are useful because they provide a graphical approach for obtaining qualitatively correct graphs of the functions that satisfy a differential equation."

    "# A Rate of Change Equation for Limited Resources}\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous problem we saw that the rate of change equation $\\displaystyle\\frac{dP}{dt}=0.3P$ can be used to model a situation where there is one species, continuous reproduction, and unlimited resources. In most situations, however, the resources are not unlimited, so to improve the model one has to modify the rate of change equation $\\displaystyle\\frac{dP}{dt}=0.3P$ to account for the fact that resources are limited. \n",

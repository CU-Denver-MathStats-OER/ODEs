    "Slope fields are a convenient way to visualize solutions to a single differential equation. For systems of autonomous differential equations the equivalent representation is a \\textbf{vector field}. Similar to a slope field, a vector field shows a selection of vectors with the correct slope but with a normalized length. In the previous problem you plotted a few such vectors but typically more vectors are needed to be able to visualize the solution in the phase plane.\n",

    "\\item You may have noticed in problem \\ref{09problem9} that along $x = 0$ all the vectors have the same slope. Similarly for vectors along the $y = x$. Any line or curve along which vectors all have the same slope is called an \\textbf{isocline}. An isocline where $dx/dt = 0$ is called an $\\mathbf{x}$-\\textbf{nullcline} because there is the horizontal component to the vector is zero and hence the vector points straight up or down. An isocline where $dy/dt = 0$ is called a $\\mathbf{y}$-\\textbf{nullcline} because the vertical component of the vector is zero and hence the vector points left or right. On a grid from -4 to 4 for both axes, plot all nullclines for the following system: \\label{09problem10parta}\n",

The inner-most ring starts about 4,000 miles above Saturn, and the rings extend out to 50,000 miles. The Cassini division is the biggest gap in the rings at 3,000 miles wide, and it is the result of resonance in the orbital frequencies between ice particles in the ring and the moon [Mimas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimas_(moon)).\n",

    "Mimas orbits Saturn every $22.5$ hours. At one point, (long long ago) there were particles in the ring that orbited every $11.25$ hours. Every two orbits, those particles felt a big pull in the same direction due to the gravity of Mimas. As a result, those ice particles were pulled further out towards Mimas. The particles eventually slowed down as they were pulled further from Saturn, breaking the resonance with Mimas and resettling into a new orbit. Thus, we have the Cassini division!\n",

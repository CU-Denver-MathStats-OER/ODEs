    "\n",
    "**Glass Breaking**: You probably have all seen in cartoons or on Mythbusters where a wineglass is broken by singing a particular high-pitched note. The phenomenon that makes this possible is called **resonance**. Resonance results from the fact that the crystalline structures of certain solids have natural frequencies of vibration. An external force of the same frequency will \"resonate\" with the object and create a huge increase in energy. For instance, if the frequency of a musical note matches the natural vibration of a crystal wineglass, the glass will vibrate with increasing amplitude until it shatters. The following is one model for understanding resonance.\n",

    "**Tacoma Narrows Bridge**: The Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington State was one of the largest suspended bridges built at the time. The bridge connecting the Tacoma Narrows channel collapsed in a dramatic way on Thursday November 7, 1940. Winds of 35-46 miles/hours produced an oscillation which eventually broke the construction. The bridge began first to vibrate torsionally, giving it a twisting motion. Later the vibrations entered a natural resonance (same term as in the glass breaking) with the bridge. Here is a simplified second order differential equation that models the situation of the Tacoma Bridge.\n",

    "There are many other situations that can be modeled with second order differential equations, including mass-spring systems, RLC circuits, pendulums, car springs bouncing, etc. In this section you will learn how to solve second order linear differential equations with constant coefficients. That is, equations where $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are constant. If $G$ is zero, then the equation is called **homogeneous**. When $G$ is nonzero then the equation is called **non-homogeneous**. As you will discover in the sections that follow, the distinction between homogeneous and non-homogeneous equations will be quite useful."

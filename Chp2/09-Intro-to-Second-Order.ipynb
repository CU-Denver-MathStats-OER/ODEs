    "**Glass Breaking**: You probably have all seen in cartoons or on Mythbusters where a wineglass is broken by singing a particular high-pitched note. The phenomenon that makes this possible is called **resonance**. Resonance results from the fact that the crystalline structures of certain solids have natural frequencies of vibration. An external force of the same frequency will \"resonate\" with the object and create a huge increase in energy. For instance, if the frequency of a musical note matches the natural vibration of a crystal wineglass, the glass will vibrate with increasing amplitude until it shatters. The following is one model for understanding resonance.\n",
